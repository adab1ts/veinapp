## Development Environment

#### Prerequesites

You must install and configure the following packages on your development machine:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Node 6.9+ and NPM 4+](http://nodejs.org/)

In order to extend veinapp's functionality you should install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/):

```shell
# Uninstall any previous version
npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli

# Clear entire cache
npm cache clean

# Install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli@1.0.0-rc.2
```

See [Resources](#resources) section for more information on Angular CLI.

#### Set up instructions

This application relies on [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) as its data store. So first sign in to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), head to the console and create your project. Then grab your initialization data.

This application also relies on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/geocoding/) as its geocoding service provider. Create a [Mapbox account](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/) and grab your Access token as explained [here](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-access-tokens-work/).

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the main [Veinapp repository](https://github.com/adab1ts/veinapp.git) from GitHub and then...

```shell
# Clone your fork (https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/):
git clone git@github.com:<github username>/veinapp.git

# Go to the project directory:
cd veinapp

# Add the main Veinapp repository as an upstream remote to your repository:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/adab1ts/veinapp.git

# Tell local git to get information about upstream remote:
git fetch upstream

# Point local copy of master branch to upstream to be able to pull the latest changes of upstream repository:
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master

# Check that your local branches track the proper remotes:
git branch -vv

# Install project dependencies:
npm install

# Edit Mapbox configuration files and update it with your data
cp src/config/mapbox.{ts.sample,ts}
vi src/config/mapbox.ts

cp src/config/mapbox.{ts.sample,prod.ts}
vi src/config/mapbox.prod.ts

# Edit Firebase configuration files and update it with your data
cp src/config/firebase.{ts.sample,ts}
vi src/config/firebase.ts

cp src/config/firebase.{ts.sample,prod.ts}
vi src/config/firebase.prod.ts

# To populate firebase with the list of places and their coordinates:
# 1. Place your JSON/CSV data files at db/data folder following this structure:
#    [{
#      "name": "the name",
#      "address": "the address",
#      "zip": "00000",
#      "city": "the city",
#      "telephone": "999 999 999",
#      "email": "email@email.com",
#      "web": "www.the-web.com",
#      "group": "the group",
#      "type": "the type",
#      "latitude": "00.00000",
#      "longitude": "00.00000"
#     },
#     ...
#    ]

# 2. In your console at the application root execute the following script
#    (check out the examples in the usage information):
npm run db:populate

# 3. In firebase console go to the rules tab in your project view
#    and add the following rule in order to index and have better querys:
#    "coords": {
#      ".indexOn": ["g"]
#    }

# Run tests:
ng test

# Run the development server:
ng serve
```

If everything works, then you're ready to make changes.


## Coding Standards

#### Style Guide

All code must follow the styles dictated by the official [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide). As long as you use Angular CLI and don't skip the git hooks, you shouldn't need to worry about missing something.

Angular projects created using Angular CLI (like this) include [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer) as a dependency. Codelyzer will check your code against the Angular tslint rules every time you run `ng lint` or commit your changes.

#### Commit messages

Follow [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) to write your commit messages. To ease this task you can use [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).

This repo is [Commitizen-friendly](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly) and supports Commitizen out-of-the-box:

* define an alias like `alias nbin='PATH=$(npm bin):$PATH'` as detailed in this
[Stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9679932/how-to-use-package-installed-locally-in-node-modules/15157360#15157360) and
* invoke it like this: `nbin git-cz`.

If you feel comfortable with global packages you can:

1. install [npm-run](https://github.com/timoxley/npm-run) by running `npm i -g npm-run` and then invoke `npm-run git-cz` to commit your messages, or
2. install commitizen by running `npm i -g commitizen` and commit your messages invoking `git cz`.

## Contributing Guidelines

#### Acceptable Submissions

We will only accept submissions that:

- report a bug in the source code.
- propose a missing feature.

If you find a bug, please submit an issue or a Pull Request (PR) with your fix.
If you miss a feature, you may:

- craft it and submit it as a PR when it is small enough.
- open an issue and outline your proposal for further discussion when it is a major one before you spend time working on it.

#### Submmitting an Issue

Before you [submit an issue](https://github.com/adab1ts/veinapp/issues/new), please search the issue tracker,
maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

Before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. Provide a minimal reproduction scenario using http://plnkr.co/.
If plunker is not a suitable way to demonstrate the problem please create a standalone git repository demonstrating the problem.

#### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your PR consider the following guidelines:

```shell
# Create a new branch:
git checkout -b my-branch staging

# Make your changes and try to make the tests pass.
# All the tests are executed on our Continuous Integration infrastructure
# and a PR could only be merged once the tests pass:
ng test --single-run
ng e2e

# If you can't or need help then commit what you have with `--no-verify`:
git add . && git commit --no-verify

# If you get things working add your changed files and commit with a message
# that follows our standards (see above). You'll notice that there are git hooks in place
# which will run testing, linting, etc. (unless you commit with `--no-verify`):
git add . && git cz

# Push your changes to your fork:
git push -u origin my-branch

# In GitHub, send a PR to `veinapp:staging`.
# Follow our feedback and iterate on the solution until we accept it.

# Rebase and squash your branch:
git rebase -i staging

# Add upstream/staging updates to your branch:
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/staging

# Push to your fork (this will update your PR):
git push -f

# Get merged! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ
```

After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

```shell
# Update your staging with the latest upstream version:
git checkout staging -f
git pull --ff upstream staging

# Update your master with the latest upstream version:
git checkout master -f
git pull --ff upstream master

# Delete the remote branch on GitHub:
git push origin --delete my-branch

# Delete the local branch:
git branch -D my-branch
```
